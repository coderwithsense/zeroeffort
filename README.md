**ZeroEffort — AI Productivity Assistant for Solopreneurs**

ZeroEffort is a minimal, smart productivity tool powered by AI — built for freelancers, indie hackers, and creators who want clarity without the chaos.

It helps you:

* Plan tasks effortlessly with an AI agent
* Detect burnout using context-aware memory
* Sync calendars and automate recurring routines
* Track progress using a "Metadata Brain" — your persistent second brain

**Why ZeroEffort?**

* Personalized nudges
* Workflow automation
* Long-term context retention

No tabs. No overthinking. Just get stuff done.

* AI: LangGraph, OpenAI/GPT, Metadata Context Protocol (MCP), RAG
* Backend: FastAPI, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL
